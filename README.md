The output of this exercise can be useful to keep government records to develop public policies related to taxation, welfare, and social security.
Your Role:*
Build a classification model using different classification models to predict a income class into UCLA.
Specifics:
Machine Learning task: Classification model
Target variable: Admit_Chance
Input variables: Refer to data dictionary below
